# Python Exercise Scripts

This repository contains standalone Python scripts used for practice in a programming course. Each file is a small exercise that can be run from the command line.

## Examples

- `Hello.py.py` – asks for your name and prints a greeting.
- `Area.py` – calculates the area of a rectangle or circle based on user input.
- `RandomInt.py` – generates random numbers within user‑defined ranges.
- `HigherThan10.py` – collects numbers greater than 10 until you enter -1.
- `hourglass.py` – prints a star shaped hourglass pattern.

To run any exercise, execute:

```bash
python <filename.py>
```

Each script expects any required input via the terminal.
